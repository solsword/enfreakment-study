One day, his friend and owner of a company involved in the oil industry died suddenly under mysterious circumstances. In the postmortem the death was listed as accidental, but Shaheen suspected foul play when his friend's company was suddenly bought by G Corporation and the management, all family members, resigned.

One day, his friend and owner of a company involved in the oil industry died suddenly under mysterious circumstances. In the postmortem the death was listed as accidental, but Shaheen suspected foul play when his friend's company was suddenly bought by G Corporation and the management, all family members, resigned.

Shaheen struggled to believe a real demon could exist, but his investigations revealed that Kazuya could be worse than any of hell's creations. Shaheen was torn: Should he take revenge for his friend's death by destroying that demon, or not? Wracked with doubt, he embarked on a solo mission to infiltrate G Corp.","I do not wish to hurt you, but I will fight if I must.",kazuya,Kazuya Mishima,Kazuya's,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_cs_kazuya.jpg,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_pr_kazuya.png,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_ig_kazuya.jpg,Japan,men,"Kazuya was raised as the heir to the Mishima Zaibatsu, but rebelled against his father Heihachi.
