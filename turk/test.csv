However, when Jin suddenly vanishes without a trace, Miguel's life purpose disappears along with him. From that point forward, Miguel began to wander like a specter from battle-torn town to battle-torn town. One day, as he ambled through rows of dilapidated buildings, he stumbled across a strangely familiar hooded man. There in front of him was none other than his sworn enemy, Jin. Consumed by both euphoria and rage, Miguel becomes frenzied and goes in for the kill.","You look like you're ready to lose.",paul,Paul Phoenix,Paul's,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_cs_paul.jpg,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_pr_paul.png,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_ig_paul.jpg,United States of America,men,"When Paul Phoenix, the golden boy of the martial arts world, steps into the ring, the excitement in the crowd is palpable.

With a large sum still to repay, Law was running out of ideas. As a last resort, he decided to search for a capable fighter to run the dojo. He asked his friend Paul if he knew anyone, and in his usual manner, Paul said he himself would be the perfect candidate. However, thinking that the dojo would go bust in half a day if Paul took control, Law politely refused. Instead, he put the word out that if any strong fighters wanted to try out for the job, they should come and prove their skills in combat. Challenger after challenger appeared, but none of them were good enough for Law. Then, one day, Law heard a rumor that a martial artist living in rural China was set to be the next God Fist master. Seeing this as his best chance yet, Law set off for his ancestral homeland.","There's gotta be some way i can make some money off this!"
