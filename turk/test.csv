On her first private assassination job, she was tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding… posing as the bride! During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found vaguely familiar. The man wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed to have something he wanted to say to her… Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.","You've got a date with death.",jin,Jin Kazama,Jin's,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_cs_jin.png,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_oa_jin.png,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_ig_jin.png,Male,men,Japanese,people from Japan,"The leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu and the man who declared war on the world.

Before long, local youths, jobless after the disaster, came forward asking to join the Tekken Force.

With a large sum still to repay, Law was running out of ideas. As a last resort, he decided to search for a capable fighter to run the dojo. He asked his friend Paul if he knew anyone, and in his usual manner, Paul said he himself would be the perfect candidate. However, thinking that the dojo would go bust in half a day if Paul took control, Law politely refused. Instead, he put the word out that if any strong fighters wanted to try out for the job, they should come and prove their skills in combat. Challenger after challenger appeared, but none of them were good enough for Law. Then, one day, Law heard a rumor that a martial artist living in rural China was set to be the next God Fist master. Seeing this as his best chance yet, Law set off for his ancestral homeland.","There's gotta be some way i can make some money off this!",jin,Jin Kazama,Jin's,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_cs_jin.png,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_oa_jin.png,http://web.mit.edu/pmwh/www/enfreakment-images/clean/tk7_ig_jin.png,Male,men,Japanese,people from Japan,"The leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu and the man who declared war on the world.
